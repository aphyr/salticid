Salticid
=====

Salticid is a deployment tool I wrote for Vodpod and Showyou in a couple of weekends. Its only design goals were:

1. Magic
2. More Magic

It violates every principle of good software development possible. It is clunky, slow, buggy, and dangerous.

It also worked surprisingly well. YMMV. d=('_~)=b
